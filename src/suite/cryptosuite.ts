   * The `type` property of a data integrity proof MUST contain the string `DataIntegrityProof`.

   * One of the design patterns seen in Data Integrity cryptosuites from 2012 to 2020 was use of the `type` property to
   * establish a specific type for a cryptographic suite; the Ed25519Signature2020 cryptographic suite was one such
   * specification. This led to a greater burden on cryptographic suite implementations, where every new cryptographic
   * suite required specification of a new JSON-LD Context, resulting in a sub-optimal developer experience. A
   * streamlined version of this design pattern in 2020, such that a developer would only need to include a single JSON-
   * LD Context to support all modern cryptographic suites. This encouraged more modern cryptosuites -- such as the
   * EdDSA cryptosuites and the ECDSA cryptosuites -- to be built based on the streamlined pattern.
   *
   * To improve the developer experience, authors creating new Data Integrity cryptographic suite specifications SHOULD
   * use the modern pattern -- where the `type` property is set to `DataIntegrityProof`; the `cryptosuite` property
   * carries the identifier for the cryptosuite; and any cryptosuite-specific cryptographic data is encapsulated (i.e.,
   * not directly exposed as application layer data) within `proofValue`.
