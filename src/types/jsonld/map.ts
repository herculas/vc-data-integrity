 * objects contained within the named graph which is indexed using the referencing key, which can be represented as a

 *
 * The values of the entries of an index map MUST be one of the following types:
 *
 * - string,
 * - number,
 * - boolean,
 * - `null`,
 * - node object,
 * - value object,
 * - list object,
 * - set object,
