/**
 * A node object represents zero or more properties of a node in the graph serialized by the JSON-LD document. A map is
 * a node object if it exists outside of the JSON-LD context and:
 *
 * - it is not the top-most map in the JSON-LD document consisting of no other entries than `@context` and `@graph`,
 * - it does not contain the `@value`, `@list`, or `@set` keywords, and
 * - it is not a graph object.
 *
 * The properties of a node in a graph may be spread among different node objects within a document. When that happens,
 * the keys of the different node objects need to be merged to create the properties of the resulting node.
 *
 * A node object MUST be a map. All keys which are not IRIs, compact IRIs, terms valid in the active context, or one of
 * the following keywords (or alias of such a keyword) MUST be ignored when processed:
 *
 * - `@context`
 * - `@id`
 * - `@included`
 * - `@graph`
 * - `@nest`
 * - `@type`
 * - `@reverse`, or
 * - `@index`.
 *
 * Then we consider these cases:
 *
 * - If the node object contains the `@context` key, its value MUST be `null`, an IRI reference, a context definition,
 *   or an array composed of any of these.
 * - If the node object contains the `@id` key, its value MUST be an IRI reference, or a compact IRI (including blank
 *   node identifiers).
 * - If the node object contains the `@graph` key, its value MUST be a node object or an array of zero or more node
 *   objects. If the node object also contains an `@id` keyword, its value is used as the graph name of a named graph.
 *   As a special case, if a map contains no keys other than `@graph` and `@context`, and the map is the root of the
 *   JSON-LD document, the map is not treated as a node object; this is used as a way of defining node objects that may
 *   not form a connected graph. This allows a context to be defined which is shared by all of the constituent node
 *   objects.
 * - If the node object contains the `@type` key, its value MUST be either an IRI reference, a compact IRI (including
 *   blank node identifiers), a term defined in the active context expanding into an IRI, or an array of any of these.
 * - If the node object contains the `@reverse` key, its value MUST be a map containing entries representing reverse
 *   properties. Each value of such a reverse property MUST be an IRI reference, a compact IRI, a blank node identifier,
 *   a node object or an array containing a combination of these.
 * - If the node object contains the `@included` key, its value MUST be an included block.
 * - If the node object contains the `@index` key, its value MUST be a string.
 * - If the node object contains the `@nest` key, its value MUST be a map or an array of map which MUST NOT include a
 *   value object.
 *
 * Keys in a node object that are not keywords MAY expand to an IRI using the active context. The values associated with
 * keys that expand to an IRI MUST be one of the following:
 *
 * - string,
 * - number,
 * - boolean,
 * - `null`,
 * - node object,
 * - graph object,
 * - value object,
 * - list object,
 * - set object,
 * - an array of zero or more of any of the possibilities above,
 * - a language map,
 * - an index map,
 * - an included block
 * - an id map, or
 * - a type map.
